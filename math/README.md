When I am studing math I often have this feeling: 'Hey, just wondering if I would be able to do this with objects in Python?'.
I'm sure you know what I mean! 

Therefore be aware that the code in this directory was written purely for learning and excercising purposes. It is not recommended 
to use it because there are already better ways or even specific libraries to achieve the same results.
