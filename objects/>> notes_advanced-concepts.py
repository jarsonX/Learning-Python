Abstraction: #A principle of object-oriented programming that states that only essential information 
#should be made visible to the outside program.

Polymorphism: #The principle that a method call can behave differently depending on the arguments 
#and object with which it is called.

Inheritance: #A principle of object-oriented programming where classes can be created that are 
#“subclasses” of other classes, inheriting all the variables and methods from the other class while 
#supplying new variables, methods, or behaviors of these own.
