Object-oriented programming: a programming paradigm where programmers define custom data types that 
have custom methods embedded within them.

Object: An object is a custom data structure that organizes and encapsulates variables and methods 
into a single data type. It is used near-interchangeably with “instance.”

Class: A custom data type comprised of multiple variables and/or methods. Instances or objects are 
created based on the template provided by the class.

Instance: A single set of values of a particular class. Classes may be comprised of multiple 
variables; an instance is a set of values for these variables. The term “instance” is often used
interchangeably with the term “object”.
