#Python comes with a built-in library called pprint, which stands for pretty-print. 
#Using this library, we can print out more nicely formatted data structures, including 
#dictionaries.

#The pprint library allows us to specify a number of different parameters, including 
#the following:

    #indent: the number of spaces to indent each line, where the default value is 1
    #width: the maximum caharacters that are allowed on a single line, where the default 
      #is None (meaning, the maximum)
    #depth: the number of levels to show while using nested data types, where the default 
      #is None (meaning that all levels of depth are shown)
    #stream: used to specify an output stream and can be used to save to a file
    #compact: If set to True, the values will be printed on single lines, to a certain 
      #width
    #sort_dicts: if True, it prints the key-value pairs according to an alphabetical order 
      #of the keys. Defaults to True
