  Mutable Variable: A variable whose value can change after it has been declared. 

  Immutable Variable: A variable whose value cannot change after it has been declared.

  Methods: Functions that are contained within data types.


ADVANCED DATA STRUCTURES:

  Multi-Dimensional Lists: A list-like structure where the items in a list are themselves lists, such that the practical effect is a multi-dimensional list.

  Stack: A list-like structure that follows the “Last-In-First-Out” paradigm, where we can only access the most recently-added item on the list and can only access it by removing it from the list.

  Queue: A list-like structure that follows the “First-In-First-Out” paradigm, where we can only access the least recently-added item on the list  and can only access it by removing it from the list.

  Linked List: A list-like structure where the location of each item in the list is contained in the previous item in the list.
